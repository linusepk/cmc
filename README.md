# CMC

A more traditional way to make Minecraft datapacks.

A language, syntax stolen from C, that compiles to a Minecraft datapack.

## Why?

I started my programming journey with Minecraft commands and has always loved them.

When they updated the execute command in 1.13 I was so mad because they overhauled the command.
Retrospectively, I can now say it's such a powerful command that's way better than it was, but being young and dumb, I was mad.
It was something new I didn't want to learn it.
So, in all my wisdom, instead of just learning it I decided to learn game development.

Five years later, I wanted to revisit my first love but soon found I'd grown complacent in real programming languages.
The ease of creating variable in other languages made the hoops you had to jump through, only to store something, a real shock.

So now I've decided to combine datapacks with traditional programming.
I just borrowed C syntax so we can have syntax highlighting in every IDE without a bunch of extra work.
